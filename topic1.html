    <h2>Top 5 countries to visit in the summer</h2>

<p>If you’re anything like us at Meyija travels, you probably have one 
  too many countries on your travel bucket list! But how can we blame
  ourselves. After coming out of a lockdown that seemed like forever 
  and navigating a world post-covid without restrictions,  it’s no 
  wonder travel lovers started thinking big again when it comes to 
  their next vacay.  
  Now we know you’re probably going to get carried away when it 
  comes to picking travel destinations. From Europe to the Caribbean, 
  the Middle East or the Americas. We are most certainly spoilt for 
  choice! 
  But Meyija travels have come together to make sure that you don’t 
  miss out on the top 5 countries to visit.</p>

           <ol>
            <li>
              <strong> 5: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil</strong>: Starting at Number 5 on the list is 
              Brazil. "Rio de Janeiro has always been an iconic city in the world. 
              Home to rich culture, beautiful landscapes and instantly 
              recognisable landmarks, Brazil is a place you go to have maximum 
              enjoyment. Make sure you try to catch the Rio Carnival.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              <strong> 4: Japan</strong>: When someone said visiting Tokyo is like visiting
              the future they were not lying. At the peak of technology and 
              everything modern is Tokyo. Get lost in the flashing lights and the 
              hustle and bustle of the busy streets. And one thing you MUST have 
              on your to-do list is the Mario Street Go Karting.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              <strong> 3: Bali, Indonesia</strong>: If you haven’t got this destination on your list 
              yet, you most  certainly need to. Beautiful beaches, scenery and 
              wildlife, Bali is a must. The locals are so friendly with a great desire 
              to share their culture, from their authentic food to their music. Bar 
              the costly flight to this amazing haven, this holiday is good value. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              <strong>2: Cape Town, South Africa</strong>: One word: vibes. South Africa is 
              definitely the place to be in summer. The culture is like no other in 
              the world but if you are a music lover, South Africa is not a 
              destination you want to miss. Parties go well into the early hours of 
              the morning, with the sounds of Amapiano coursing through the 
              streets.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              <strong> 1: Bridgetown Barbados</strong>: Yes, at the number one spot is none other
              than Barbados. It’s the food. It’s the culture. It’s the people. 
              Barbados is a place you will instantly fall in love with. This beautiful 
              island in the Caribbean is well known for having some of the most 
              beautiful beaches in the world. The crystal blue aquamarine waters 
              and soft silky sand put this holiday destination at the very top of all 
              of our lists.
